## Planting Stormwater Solutions

**Benefit of Adding Habitat**: 
A function of Convertible Lands as well as lands that are not Habitat. This can be expressed as a proportion, or by area. A high proportion of existing Convertible Lands and/or a low proportion of Habitat will offer a greater benefit of adding Habitat. 

**Benefit of Expanding Habitat**: 
A function of Convertible Lands AND Habitat, as well as the inverse of lands that are not Habitat. This can be expressed as a proportion, or by area. A low proportion of existing Habitat and/or a low proportion of Convertible Lands will offer a low benefit of Habitat expansion. Given blocks with a mixture of existing Habitat and Convertible Lands, those with a greater proportion of Convertible Lands will derive a greater benefit from Habitat expansion. 

**Acres of Opportunity**: 
A function of Convertible Lands. We assume these lands can be converted into Habitat. High hectarage or proportion of Convertible Lands offers greater opportunity to increase Habitat for plants and dependent animals. 

**Opportunity, proportional**: 
This is a function of Convertible Lands. We assume these lands can be converted into Habitat. High hectarage or proportion of Convertible Lands offers greater opportunity to increase Habitat for plants and dependent animals. 

**Pollutant Load**: 
We developed a unitless, area-weighted and normalized Block Pollutant Loading metric by summing estimated loading for fecal coliform, Total Copper (Cu), Total Lead (Pb) and Total Zinc (Zn) for land use polygons within each block. Fecal coliform and metals were chosen because they are common pollutants for which Total Maximum Daily Loads are in place in Los Angeles and they are indicative of exposure risk to humans and in-stream organisms respectively. The metric doesn’t provide information related to absolute loading, but rather makes relative comparisons between blocks based on land use and area. Values of 0.5 or greater are considered Very High. 

**Social and Public Health Rank (SPH)**: 
The SPH score is the average score of six indicators: Air Quality Pollution Burden, Economic Hardship, Urban Heat, Lack of Greenspace, race/ethnicity, and Population Density. We calculated the average rank of the above indicators. These averages range from 1.3–8.7. We calculated natural breaks which identified the highest scoring tracts that have values of 6.9 or greater. 
 


## Afforestation and Urban Heat 

**Tree Gap Closing Score**: 
Ranked score (0-100) identifying the suitability of census block groups for tree planting to address tree cover disparity. 

**UHI Gap Closing Score**: 
Ranked score (0-100) identifying the suitability of census block groups for tree planting to address UHI disparity. 

**Current UHI**: 
The mean summer urban heat island impact. 

**UHI Gap**: 
The difference in UHI between this census block group and the highest income quartile for the city. 

**Current Tree Canopy**: 
The percent of the census block group area covered by tree canopy. 

**Tree Gap**: 
The difference in percent tree cover between this census block group and the highest income quartile for the city.  

**Tree Canopy Needed to Close UHI Gap**: 
The additional canopy cover needed (%) to close the UHI Gap.
