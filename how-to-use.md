These three dashboards and one interactive map display multiple characteristics of the Greater Los Angeles Region as developed and mapped in three assessments . The Nature Conservancy generated these analyses to help determine the optimal places to site nature-based solutions to support biodiversity, manage stormwater and provide a variety of additional benefits to nature and people.


**Planting Stormwater Solutions** - a methodology to prioritize siting of vegetated nature-based solutions for stormwater capture so that projects maximize benefits to biological diversity, social and public health, and water quality.

**Afforestation and Urban Heat** - an approach to strategically plant trees in California's urban areas with the goal of reducing Urban Heat Island (UHI) impacts while sequestering carbon and benefiting low-income and disadvantaged communities.

**Biodiversity Assessment in Los Angeles** - a methodology to evaluate urban biogeography through cluster analyses of multiple variables. [Link to publication](https://www.scienceforconservation.org/products/BAILA)

Each of these studies identified characteristics, across multiple themes, of the Greater Los Angeles Region. These characteristics can be used to identify, describe, and prioritize the need for siting of nature-based solutions. These dashboards and the interactive map daylight these values to enhance the studiesâ€™ abilities to reach and inform a wide audience of decision-makers, advocates, and the public.


# How to Use


The three dashboards are configured to allow the user to visualize the characteristics identified in each study within administrative areas (cities, neighborhoods, political districts) and natural areas (watersheds).  On the left-hand side of each dashboard are the characteristics of the census blocks shown on the map. Along the bottom are charts that depict the distribution of specific characteristics by neighborhood.


The default state for each map is to show the characteristics of the entire study area. These values are useful as comparisons against values for administrative and natural areas. To change the values shown, select an administrative or watershed area by choosing its name from the list on the right-hand side of the map. This will filter the map to show data only from within those areas. To change the list of names, click on the left or right arrow below the list.  To deselect a name and return to the full study area, click again on the selected name. Use "Selection" instrument in the upper left corner of the map to select multiple census block groups or neighborhoods. The selection filters the list of administrative areas to only show those included in the selected area. Use the cross that appears on the place of "Selection" instrument to clear selection. The active selection from the charts or the list applies to all the informative layers of the map, so if you change the visible layer, the selection stays. 

To change the characteristic being shown in the chart in the lower part of the dashboard, select one of the tabs below the charts. Two of the dashboards have one or more charts on the left-hand side that can be used for filtering the map contents and other elements. Click on one of the categories on the chart to only see those census block groups that fall into that category. All the other charts of this kind will reflect the change and only show the categories of the selection. You can click on the other chart in addition to that to apply a second parametern to narrow down your results. Inaddition to that, the charts and indicators on the left-hand side change with zooming to show the information about the area visible on the screen at the moment.  


The Identifying Priority Areas tab allows you to identify priority areas based on single characteristics or combinations of characteristics. The boxes on the right side of the screen allow the user to enter threshold or exact values to see the subset of blocks that meet the filter criteria. See the Glossary tab and
